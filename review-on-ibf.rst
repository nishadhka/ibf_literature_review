Review on Impact Based Forecasting
=======================================


The paper :cite:p:`merz2020impact` reports review of about 400 research articles for assessing the background and challenges involved with IBF. The paper reports state of the art IBF for major hazard types such as 

#. Extratropical Windstorms
#. Severe convective storm
#. Droughts and Heat Waves
#. Floods
#. Storm Surges
#. Earthquakes
#. Tsunamis
#. Volcanic Eruptions 

with forecasting factors such as lead time, spatial aggregation, impact model involved in forecasting, main uncertainties involved and forecasting method maturity and added value. The figure shows the space time scales of early warning systems in implementation for the hazard types with its maturity in practice.

The review deines the IBF as extension of traditional hazard forecast by inclusion of exposure and vulnerability of socio-economic system of the hazard likely impact location.  Converting the physical hazard forecast into socio-economic impact forecast. The following figure shows the interaction of hazard forecast and impact forecast.

Major conclusions of the review on IBF systems research are

#. IBF system is an emerging field of study
#. State of the art of IBF is differing largely for different hazard types
#. Spectrum of impact modeling approaches based on process and complexity of hazard type involved but often very simple approaches are used in practice
#. IBF requires systematic collection of exposure and vulnerability data to reduce the forecast uncertainty
#. The nature of exposure and vulnerability data being highly dynamic in space and time requires close collaboration of natural, engineering and social science field for inclusion of human factor in data production
#. Transformation of hazard forecast into indicators an important factor in IBD model further increases the complexity
#. The role of uncertainty quantification for IBF on different hazard type, need for probabilistic approach in quantification
#. There is a gap between pre event impact estimates and post event impact assessment exercise, it has to be avoided for better decision making 
#. IBF posited to improve emergency response and risk reduction, but hardly tested on the field    
#. Impact forecasting has intrinsic communication challenges involved
#. IBF has interdisciplinary close interaction between producers and end-users
#. Estimating the impact of multi hazard and cascading effect are to be important priorities of IBF system
