Data Sciences for IBF
======================

There is an article which discusses, "AI and machine learning are improving weather forecasts, but they won’t replace human expert".

The data sciences algorithms and tools which can be used in terms of IBF can be grouped based on its application as follows. 

Improving Hazard forecasting
-----------------------------

#. Atmospheric Weather Prediction Using various machine learning Techniques: A Survey :footcite:t:`l_atmospheric_2019`
#. Predicting weather forecast uncertainty with machine learning :footcite:t:`scher_predicting_2018`


For Exposure/Vulnerability data-production
------------------------------------------
#. Explore Global ML building foorprints data and any other land cover data set to check for availability of slums land cover in it.
#. In case of data non availability, this could be a better option to generate https://developmentseed.org/blog/2022-03-15-open-sourcing-pearl/
