Climate Story Lines
======================

Climate risk management for regional/local level are based on climate information downscaled from Global Circulation Models and probabilistic uncertainty indicator. This method has issues of local knowledge inadequacy and randomness uncertainty. There is growing call for check alternative methods for this approach. One approach is using Climate Story Lines :footcite:t:`shepherd2018storylines`, which aims to understand and describe regional/local climate events based on plausible factors. We can observe the parallel of this method with the causal inference approach and its application in machine learning methods :footcite:t:`pearl_book_2018`. Downward Counterfactual, a tool/concept used in causal inference approach has application in analysis of different plausible factors/scenario analysis of climate events. Counterfactual thinking refers to imagining alternative past and assessing the eevent outcome, either postive change indicated as upward or negative change as downward :footcite:t:`counterfacturalroese1999counterfactual`.  

Climada framework and software tools were used in downward counterfactual analysis for generating the climate storylines on Flood disaster in EU to check the adequacy of EU Solidarity Fund :footcite:t:`ciullo_framework_2021`. There is a online tool used to generate climate storylines based bayesian networks by means of co production/participatory stakeholder involvement. https://tarokuni.shinyapps.io/eusf_bn/
