Impact Based Forecasting(IBF) - Introduction
=============================================

What is IBF
-----------

IBF-an extension of conventional hazard forecasting with factoring of socio-economic exposure and/or vulnerability. Gives more insight for anticipatory action on disaster risk resilience, combining climate forecast provides information tools for risk prevention and mitigation activities. 

The impact of a hazard event can be defined as the sum of vulnerability, coping capacity with exposure and hazard extent. The impact forecast extend the hazard forecast with probability of impact occurring in location.\ :footcite:t:`free2022improving`.

Impact= (Vulnerability x Coping Capcaicty) + Exposure + Hazard

In the process of IBF, a chain of five components are involved as indicated by Zang 2019 :footcite:t:`zhang2019increasing` though they are currently practiced in silos, IBF intended to bridge the gap between them, to improve the values of weather related warnings. The five components are

   IBF chain

1. data collection on exposure and vulnerability, past impact profile
2. Hazard forecasting, involves weather and climate model output, ensemble forecast output
3. Impact forecasting combining the first two components 
4. Warning based on impact forecast threshold
5. Decision making and Anticipatory action

IBF model combines these components especially the first three components and produce impact forecast.

IBF in East Africa context 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Studies :footcite:t:`mwangi_mainstreaming_2021` and :footcite:t:`boult_towards_2022` showed the development of drought hazard impact based forecasting for Kenya and East AFrica context. While :footcite:t:`nkiaka_exploring_2020` explored the user prespective need for IBF in West Africa.
